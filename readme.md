# Developer Excercise

As a part of our BI Project, we were tasked with developing a website which embedded some of our visualisations from the Qlik Sense App we created to tell a narative.
## Used Libraries
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Fontawesome Icons](fontawesome.com/)
- [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com/)

## Using the solution
To host the solution, I used [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) its Apache webserver.
The files belonging to the webapp that are used, are directly located in the `C:\xampp\htdocs\bi` folder.
You can find the solution at [Localhost/bi/index.html](http://localhost/bi/index.html), but in order to see the visualisations, you obviously need the right credentials.
